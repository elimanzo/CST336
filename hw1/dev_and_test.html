                    &emsp;&emsp;This part of the phases focuses on creating the code.
                    The development process follows the design planned and the requirements
                    that has been mapped. If the past phases were followed and organize
                    this step could be accomplished with ease. Developers follow coding 
                    guidelines followed by their organization.

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>
                   &emsp;&emsp;After building the code it is tested againsts any requirements
                   and defects from the past phases. Testing involves reports, tracking, 
                   fixing, and re-testing methods to figure out solutions.Testing for software 
                   defficiency improves the quality of the product for the users.
