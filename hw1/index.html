                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The software development life cycle (SLDC) model represents squential phases 
                that must be met to produce a time efficient, cost-efficient, and 
                high-quality software for the customer or user. Each phases consist 
                of deliverables required by the next phase. The phases are the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class = "phase">Requirement Analysis:</span> This phase consist of a plan, which describes the constraints.</li>
                    <li><span class = "phase">Design:</span> This phase is a design plan based on sofware specification.</li>
                    <li><span class = "phase">Development:</span> This phase builds the code.</li>
                    <li><span class = "phase">Testing:</span> This phase tests for deficiencies of the software.</li>
                    <li><span class = "phase">Maintenance:</span> This phase continously updates and advances the software.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;The SLDC consist of many models which have different utilizations. 
                    This website will describe the <em><strong>Waterfall</strong></em>
                    model and how the sequential flow is structured.
